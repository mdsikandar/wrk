# Difference between enviromental variables and shell variables

Enviromental variables are variables that are defined for the current shell
    and are inherited by any child shells or processes. Enviromental variabl    es are used to
    pass information into process that are released from the shell


Shell variables are variable that are contained exclusively within the shell
    in which they were set or defined. They are often used to keep track of 
    ephemeral data, like the current working directory.
