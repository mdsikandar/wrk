#defination of enum and uses of enum and format

defination : Enumeration (enum) is a user defined data type in C.
    It is mainly used to assign name to integral constants.
    The names make a program to easy to read and maintain.


Advantage of enum:
    the advantage of enum over macro :
    a) Enums follow scope rules.
    b) Enums variable are automatically assigned. Following is simpler

    example:
    enum flag { constant1, constant2... }


    example 2:
     enum week{Mon, Tue, Wed,..., Sun}
     int main ()
     {
         enum week day;
         day = Wed;
         printf("%d", day);
         return 0;
    }
    In the above example, we declared “day” as the variable and
    the value of “Wed” is allocated to day, which is 2.
    So as a result, 2 is printed.

# All enum constants must be unique in their scope .
    example:
    enum state {working, failed}
    enum result {failed, passed}
    int main() {return 0;}

    / compilation error: failed has previous declaration
