parts and working of hub
          -Hub is an layer 1 device and it connect multiple device using physical layer
		Hubs are layer 1 devices,Hubs are just splitters. It simply receives frames in the ingress
	         port and sends it out to all other ports. It knows nothing about MAC address.
          -Physical layer is twisted pair cable,half duplex mode
          -Types of hub - Active hub - Repeaters
                         - Passive hub -No modifications on packets
           -it uses carrier sense multiple access with collision domain (CSMA/CD)
    -RJ 45 or 8P8C coupler
           -RJ-Registered jack – it used in telepahone networks
           -8P8C- 8 pin and 8 contact – All the pins gapped with 1mm apart
           -it has voltage drop
    -Switch
           -it is an layer 2 device and it store MAC addresss of all the device
           -full duplex mode
    -Bridge
           -it works on data link layer and it connect one network to another with same  protocol
    -Router
            -it is an layer 3 device and it stores ip address of devices
    -modes of operation on networking
            -AP mode - Access point
            -Router mode
            -Wireless mode distribution system - points to MAC address of the device
    -Difference between modem,AP
            -Modem is used to transrecive the datas
            -Access point is used to create a private network
    -The path is
             Internet->Modem->Router->Access point
    -FDB table - stores the MAC address of the device
    -iptables
             -It is used to accept,drop and reject the input and output from the user
    -Packet mangling
             -change the ip layer information in packets and it perform using NAT operation
             -The process consists of
                   -prerouting
                   -Input
                   -forward
                   -output
                   -postrouting
